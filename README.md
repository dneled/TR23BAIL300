# Azure ML Churn Tutorial

This is all documentation and materials for the Azure Machine Learning Tutorial (e.g. as given at TechReady23).

Please download all materials by clicking "Download ZIP". Then open the .doc file for the manual. Note that because this was given on a VM in an instructor led lab, the path references will be different when doing it outside the lab (e.g. C:/Lab1 folder won't exist - please find the material within the github)

Associated Azure ML experiments are here: https://gallery.cortanaanalytics.com/Collection/Azure-ML-Churn-Tutorial-1 to check your work or in case you get stuck at a step.
